Refraction**\n- Light bends when entering different materials\n- Makes straws look bent in water\n- Used in lenses\n\n**3. Absorption**\n- Material takes in light\n- Dark colors absorb more\n- Converted to heat energy\n\n## Transparent, Translucent, Opaque\n\n- **Transparent:** See through clearly (glass)\n- **Translucent:** Some light passes (frosted glass)\n- **Opaque:** No light passes (wood, metal)",
